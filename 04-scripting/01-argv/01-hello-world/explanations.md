# Assignment

Better late than never: your first Pythonic Hello World application.
Write a *script* `hello-world.py` that, when run on the shell, prints `Hello world`.

Note how we asked for a *script*, not a function. A script is a file that contains code (in our case, Python code):

```python
# say-bla.py

print('bla')
```

Ypyttou can leave the first line out, it's simply meant to tell you
what the name of the file is.
To run this script, enter the following command in a terminal (*not* a Python shell):

```bash
$ python say-bla.py
bla
```

There is no `main` function in Python: whatever code there is on the top level
(i.e., not in a function) is executed.

You are now ready to write your first Hello World script. Wield that power responsibly.
